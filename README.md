# AutoStarter

AutoStarter is an IoT project designed for the ESP8266 module that automates the process of starting devices or processes at specified times. Utilizing a web server hosted on the ESP8266, users can schedule times for operations to begin, offering a versatile solution for automating tasks in a home or office environment.

### Features

- **Schedule Automation**: Set up times for operations to start directly through a web interface.
- **Web Server**: Built-in ESP8266WebServer to handle HTTP requests.
- **NTP Time Sync**: Utilizes NTP to synchronize the ESP8266's time with internet time servers, ensuring accurate scheduling.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and expand for various automation tasks.
- **LED Indicator**: Uses the ESP8266's built-in LED to indicate operation status (can be customized or expanded to control other devices).

### Requirements

- ESP8266 Module
- Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed
- Basic understanding of electronics and programming

### Installation

1. **Set Up Your ESP8266 Environment**:
   Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed and the ESP8266 board support added. [Follow this guide for setup instructions](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).

2. **Load the Sketch**:
   Open the `AutoStarter.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

3. **Configure WiFi**:
   Modify the `ssid` and `password` constants in the sketch to match your WiFi network credentials.

4. **Flash Your ESP8266**:
   Connect your ESP8266 module to your computer, select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE, and upload the sketch.

### Usage

1. **Access the Web Server**:
   Once the ESP8266 starts, connect to the IP address shown in the Serial Monitor from any web browser.

2. **Schedule Tasks**:
   Use the web interface to set up start times for your tasks. The interface allows you to input a start and end time for operations.

3. **Monitoring**:
   The built-in LED on the ESP8266 will indicate the operation status based on your schedule. Custom code can be added to control other devices.
